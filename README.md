## About Amino

Amino, the Distributed Cloud Application Platform, is an open source,
multilanguage development platform and distributed runtime environment
designed to make distributed applications much easier to design,
develop and operate.  It supports most commonly used programming
languages and is, by default, deployed and managed in container environments using
[Kubernetes](https://www.k8s.io).  


Amino is based on, and extends, several years of research work done at
the [University Of Washington Computer Systems
Lab](https://syslab.cs.washington.edu/research/) in
Seattle.<sup>1,2,3,4,5</sup> 

Amino is alpha software, and not yet
suitable for production use.  We have a well-funded development team
actively working on getting it to production readiness, and actively
support contributions from the open source community.
