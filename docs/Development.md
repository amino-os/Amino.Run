# Development

### Development Workflow
Please refer to Kubernetes workflow in GitHub:
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/github-workflow.md

### Environment Setup

#### 1. Download Android Studio (Windows or Linux all are fine). Latest version or 3.0
* Download Gradle update if necessary (Android Studio will inform you).
* Install JDK (latest version) if you don't have one.

#### 2. Be Familiar with Development Workflow
* Read [development workflow](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/github-workflow.md).  We follow Kubernetes workflow.
* Fork your own repository from [DCAP-Sapphire repository](https://github.com/Huawei-PaaS/DCAP-Sapphire) 
* `git clone` from your own repository
* Make sure to sync with the latest source before creating a pull request to Huawei-PaaS/DCAP-Sapphire.
* Make sure to rebase your code instead of simple git pull (read carefully about git pull part from above link).

#### 3. Open Android Studio.
* Open Sapphire project from the local repo you just cloned. (i.e open DCAP-Sapphire/sapphire/)
* Android Studio will ask you about missing files - click OK.

#### 4. Update IP address in application and minnieTwitter app with yours.
* Check your computers IP first.
* Go to Run -> Edit Configuration
* Configure *OMS-Twitter*

* Configure *KernelServer-Twitter*
![KernelServer-Twitter](images/KernelServer-Twitter.png)
* Configure *MinnieTwitter*
![MinnieTwitter](images/MinnieTwitter.png)

* Select the following components and change IP addresses that start with 192.168... to your IP. Don't change the port number:
* Go to examples/example/minnietwitter/src/main/java/sapphire.appexamples.minnietwitter/glue/Configuration.java
* Update the first agument (IP address) to your IP address. Don't change the port number or the second argument. (the second argument (IP Address) corresponds to the IP address of the device where this app would run, if running on a real android device, then update it to the IP address of the real android device)

#### 5. Make project and sync Gradle (order does not matter).
* If it fails, just restart and try it again.
* Android Studio may show the bar for Gradle sync. If not: Tools>Android>Sync with Gradle files.

#### 6. Congrats! Now you are ready to run OMS and Kernels.
* Run > Debug
* Choose OMS. Edit Configuration may pop up when module is not set. In this case, you can simply designate Sapphire-core at 'Use classpath of module'.
* Wait until you see the bottom window showing "OMS Ready" message.
* Again Run > Debug
* Choose Kernel
* Wait until you see the bottom window showing "New kernel server" message along with IP address of the kernel.
* Click on OMS debug window to see Kernel connection message.

#### 7. You are almost done. Now you need to run Android emulator.
* Run > Debug
* Choose minnieTwitter
* It will pop up a Window where you can create a new virtual device (emulator) or you can register Android phone. For Huawei phone, please install HiSuite so you can see the device from Android Studio.
* Choose Oreo to download SDK and all other necessary components. This can take a while. You can choose any Nexus phones.

### Running OMS and Sapphire kernel in command prompt (Windows. For Linux, please replace ; to :)
If you want to manually run a Sapphire kernel (e.g., want to run on a remote server), you can execute them by running the following script after copying the jar files. Please replace IP addresses and port number to your need as necessary. In the example, 192.168.10.231 22346 is the host address for OMS, and 192.168.10.231 31111 is the host address for Sapphire Kernel. Please first create a policy file with similar content as in the following for RMI to work: 
grant {
  permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

OMS:
java -cp sapphire-core.jar;java.rmi.jar;minnietwitter.jar;apache.harmony.jar sapphire.oms.OMSServerImpl 192.168.10.231 22346 sapphire.appexamples.minnietwitter.cloud.MinnieTwitterStart

Sapphire Kernel:
java -Djava.security.manager -Djava.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly=false -Djava.security.policy=./client.policy -cp sapphire-core.jar;java.rmi.jar;minnietwitter.jar;apache.harmony.jar sapphire.kernel.server.KernelServerImpl 192.168.10.231 31111 192.168.10.231 22346

### Stub File Generation
If you change or create a new deployment manager(policy), you will need to generate stub files again.
java -cp sapphire-core.jar;java.rmi.jar;apache.harmony.jar sapphire.compiler.StubGenerator DCAP-Sapphire/sapphire/sapphire-core/src/main/java/sapphire/policy sapphire.policy.stubs DCAP-Sapphire/sapphire/sapphire-core/src/main/java/sapphire/policy/stubs

### Troubleshooting
Android Studio can be unstable sometimes. Close all Android Studio projects and restart when you observe unexpected behavior.
Do not try to change Android Emulator as it can cause RMI incompatibility issue if not done properly.
If any of the process fails for some unknown reason, you may consider creating a new directory and clone the repository again.

* Emulator does not show up or ADB server initialization fails on Android Studio in Windows.

Find which task is using 5037 port by the following commands:
netstat -ano | findstr :5037
tasklist | findstr processID (e.g tasklist | findstr 832)

If it is used by svchost.exe, I think it is wise to avoid killing this system process.
Run adb in a different port after setting up Environment variable:
adb -P 5038 start-server
In Windows, go to Environment Variables â€“ Add a new one called ANDROID_ADB_SERVER_PORT and set it to whatever you want, e.g., 5038 (or 5039). Scroll down the to the screen show from below linked page:
